# Basebone


designed to gain a understanding of how you would approach a real world business problem. Attached is a category schema that will form the basis of the project. Using NodeJS you will need to create a CRUD micro-serivce that allows for PATCH partial updates as well as allowing for param passing to page the GET results.

The following must be used:
- MongoDB
- Mongoose ODM

Other than the above feel free to use any packages or frameworks of your choosing. Keep in mind that we are trying to assess the way you code and approach the problem. Please provide unit tests for all code.
